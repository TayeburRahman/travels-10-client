                to be the Biggest Tour Company or the best Tourism Company in
                Bangladesh. We are yet to achieve our best, but we have served
                3500+ guests a year in 2019 (before the pandemic) with a 5/5
                rating in TripAdvisor.

                Travelez was awarded Trip Advisor Certificate of Excellence in
                2019 and Travelerâ€™s Choice Award in 2020. We were probably the
                fastest-growing Inbound Tour Company in Bangladesh before the
                Covid-19 pandemic that stopping the global tourism industry.
