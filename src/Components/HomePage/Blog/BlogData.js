        blogDescription: "St. Martin's Island is a small island (area only 8 km2) in the northeastern part of the Bay of Bengal, about 9 km south of the tip of the Cox's Bazar Teknaf peninsula, and forming the southernmost part of Bangladesh. There is a small adjoining island that is separated at high tide, called Chhera Island. It is about 8 kilometers (5 miles) west of the northwest coast of Myanmar, at the mouth of the Naf River. Local name of the island is Narical Gingira, also spelled Narikel Jinjira/ Jinjera, that means 'Coconut Island' in Bengali. It is the only one coral island in Bangladesh. St Martin’s Island is perfect for tourist who is truly interested in escaping the holds of a modern world. Do not expect to find taxis, tarred roads or electricity here. Lodges are dependent on generators, as the island is all about sun, sea and palm trees. During the day, the island comes alive with water and beach sports, with beach parties and bonfires lighting up the evening skies. For the use of a phone or a reminder of what a television set looks like, visitors can pop down to the Coast Guard station. It's possible to walk around the island in a day because it measures only 8 km2 (3 sq. mile), shrinking to about 5 km2 (2 sq. mi) during high tide. This is the only coral island of Bangladesh. St. Martin's Island has become a popular tourist place. Currently, some (about 5 to 6 in number) shipping liners run daily trips to the island, including Sea-Truck and Keary-Sindbad. Tourists can book their trip either from Chittagong or from Cox's Bazar or from Dhaka. The surrounding coral reef of the island has an extension named Chera Dwip. The golden sandy sea beach and crystal clear blue water memorize you the koh lipe island of Thailand. Attractions of St. Martin's Island is Sunrise & Sunset, Sandy Beach, Coral, Moonlit Night, Engine Boat or Speed Boat Tour around the Island, Walking Through Cycling the Island, Scuba Diving, Fishing, Sea Bath & Sun Bath, Sea Fish Fry, Coconut Water, Samudra Bilash (The home of the late popular poet of Bangladesh Dr. Humayun Ahmed.

        blogDescription: "The beauty of Bangladesh has been increased much for the division of Chittagong, and the Chittagong Hill Tracts. It was a pleasing experience to explore some extremely beautiful spots in Rangamati. All tourists main attraction in Rangamati is Hanging Bridge which built over the Kaptai Lake. For entry, you have to get the entrance ticket and from here you can hire a boat to visit Shubhalang Waterfall. This is one popular restaurant Peda Ting Ting to taste tribal food. Many boating packages are available to enjoy boating here. Tourists do buy many local handicrafts from the tribal shop outside of this spot. There are a variety of attractions here, aside from the gorgeous lake itself. For one thing, there is the famous Hanging Bridge, which Bangladeshis call “Jhulonto Bridge” and which is quite well-known in the country. Then there is the Gagra waterfall. The people themselves are a delight too, for this is a region rich in tribal cultural heritage; over half of the people in the district belong to the tribal category. As such, one may also expect to see some interesting things in the indigenous museum in the town, as well as among the people themselves. The local flavour is patent in many ways and in many places, and one need only walk around the area and do a bit of exploration (preferably with the help of a knowledgeable local guide) in the district to get a taste of this flavour. The town of Rangamati is just about 77 kilometres east of Chittagong. Note that while tourists do regularly come here, its location in the CHT (the acronym for the Chittagong Hill Tracts) does mean that the traveller has to be conscious of some necessities and precautions. The CHT-or a good part of it, anyway-is a place that was only recently pronounced safe for travel again, and there are still some lingering signs of the recent militarisation and conflict in the area. As such, travelling through the area requires the traveller to have his papers and passport ready and in order, as there are multiple checkpoints in this location. Many checkpoints require people passing through to display their permit to travel in the CHT (which means you should definitely not forget to get this) and to register in their logbooks prior to being allowed to go through.",

North, sea turtles breed on nearby Sonadia Island. Cox's Bazar sea beach is the longest sea beach in the world, 120 km long, having no 2nd instance. The wavy water of Bay of Bengal touches the beach throughout this 120 km.For Bangladeshi's it doesn't get much better than Cox's Bazar, the country's most popular beach town than the other one 'Kuakata beach town. It's sort of a Cancun of the east. It's choc-a-bloc with massive well-architectured concrete structures, affluent 5 & 3 star hotels, catering largely to the country's elite and overseas tourists. The beach is only a bit crowded in tourist season, October to March, especially near the hotel-motel zone, but remains virgin during the rest of the year, April to September, when it's better to take a trip there.The part of the 120 km beach is named differently having diversified flora & fauna. It starts with 'Laboni Beach,' Sughandha Beach' within the Cox's Bazar region and 10 km south is known as 'Himchari Beach',30 km fur known as 'Inani Beach' and more 70 km off is the 'Teknaf Beach'.

In the Bhutanese Himalayas, there are peaks higher than 7,000 meters (23,000 ft) above sea level. Gangkhar Puensum is Bhutan's highest peak and was until recently the highest unclimbed mountain in the world. The wildlife of Bhutan is notable for its diversity, including the Himalayan takin. The capital and largest city is Thimphu. Bhutan and neighboring Tibet experienced the spread of Buddhism which originated in the Indian subcontinent during the lifetime of Gautama Buddha. In the first millennium, the Vajrayana school of Buddhism spread to Bhutan from the southern Pala Empire of Bengal. Tibet, Bhutan, Sikkim and parts of Nepal became the vestiges of the Mahayana schools amid the decline of Buddhism in India. Bhutan also came under the influence of the Tibetan Empire. During the 16th century, Ngawang Namgyal unified the valleys of Bhutan into a single state. Namgyal defeated three Tibetan invasions, subjugated rival religious schools, codified the Tsa Yig legal system, and established a government of theocratic and civil administrators. Namgyal became the first Zhabdrung Rinpoche and his successors acted as the spiritual leaders of Bhutan like the Dalai Lama in Tibet. During the 17th century, Bhutan controlled large parts of northeast India, Sikkim and Nepal; it also wielded significant influence in Cooch Behar State. Bhutan ceded the Bengal Duars to British India during the Bhutan War in the 19th century. The House of Wangchuck emerged as the monarchy and pursued closer ties with the British in the subcontinent. In 1910, a treaty guaranteed British advice in foreign policy in exchange for internal autonomy in Bhutan. The arrangement continued under a new treaty with India in 1949 in which both countries recognized each other's sovereignty. Bhutan joined the United Nations in 1971. It has since expanded relations with 55 countries, including Bangladesh, Israel, Kuwait, Brazil, Japan, Thailand, and Turkey; as well as the European Union. While dependent on the Indian military, Bhutan maintains its own military units.",
